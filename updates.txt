- Need to add either a pdf for context, json file. ✅
- Use a UI (i.e, Tauri Overlay) to import that pdf, but for testing purposes, should create one.
- Whatever answer is generated, note that down into the vector database with the question 
  that was asked for quicker responses, along with the links that were used to generate it.⚠️
- Add game detection so that the answer is only based on the game. 
- Add more detailed responses. (e.g step-by-step walkthroughs) ✅
- Add to the Tauri Overlay, the overlay should act like a chatbot, with responses staying and
  being able to scroll back to them.

For a later date:

- Add a contextual tips, i.e, recommendation system, which will pop up from time to time based
  on the scenario. 


- Added a hash system instead of a unique id system for the vector search to prevent 
  multiple upserts of the same thing. ✅

- Need to add a LLM that decides whether detailed answer is need or not.

- Needs to have game specific advice.
